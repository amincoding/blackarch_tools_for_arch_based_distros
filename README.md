# blackarch_tools_for_arch_based_distros

when installing blackarch repo on top of you arch based distro (arch linux , manjaro , guaruda linux, etc)
you will be able to normaly install it by folowing these long steps :
1 - clone the strap.sh file and then u need to insall it
2 - then u can run this comman : 
    sudo pacman -S blackarch
and this will download around 14gb of blackarch tools of all cateories 
but the problem is that it won't work , due to a problem with both tha manjaro repo and the blackarch one claims the same files


with out script u'll be able to install everything with one click from the strap.sh till the last tool u want (nmap , airgeddon , metasploit .... etc)
